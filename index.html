<p>Many modern 3D modelers are based on subdivision tools that are not much different from the "MeshEdit" tool you started to build your earlier assignment.  The basic idea is that the artist starts with a simple primitive like a cube, and adds more and more detail to the model via primitive operations like extruding faces and beveling edges. <a href="https://youtu.be/HawphRvPusA">Here is one example video</a>, but you can find many, many more by simply Googling "box modeling" or "subdivision modeling," which you should definitely do if you chose to pursue this project.  You should also take a look at some different modeling packages, such as <a href="http://www.wings3d.com">Wings3D</a>, <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com">Rhino</a>, <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/modo/">modo</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya">Maya</a>, and <a href="http://www.sidefx.com">Houdini</a>.  Many of these are commercial packages, but still offer a useful glimpse at the world of subdivision modeling.  A few packages (like Blender and Wings3D) are free, and you should try downloading them and playing around with them.</p>

<p>Your goal will be to develop your mesh editing software into a basic subdivision modeler.  Some directions of extension include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Additional atomic editing operations.</em>  For instance, in your previous assignment you implemented edge flips, splits, and collapses.  What are some convenient operations for polygon modeling?  Common ones include, say, face extrusion and edge beveling.  But there are many more options, and the goal of this assignment is to play around with the polygon modeling paradigm in new and creative ways.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Additional selection modes.</em>  Almost as important as convenient meshing operations are intelligent selection modes.  For instance, it is very common to allow the user to select a "loop" of faces, for things like adding additional detail around the eyes and mouth (you will see this kind of operation in many videos on box modeling).  Adding additional selection modes will require some re-thinking and re-tooling of the viewer itself, but all the fundamental code you need (picking, etc.) is already there.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Support for additional types of subdivision surfaces.</em>  In your assignment you implemented Loop subdivision, which is useful when working with triangle meshes.  However, many natural objects are more easily modeled using quadrilateral meshes, since in general surfaces will have two orthogonal directions of principal curvature.  The half edge mesh class already supports general polygon meshes; you may want to extend your subdivision support to include, say, quad meshes by implementing something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface">Catmull-Clark</a> subdivision scheme.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fast preview of subdivided surface</em>.  Also, it's worth noticing that most professional subdivision tools allow to work on a coarse "control cage" while simultaneously getting a preview of what the final subdivided surface will look like.  In other words, the user doesn't actually ever dice the surface into tiny polygons; they simply use the vertices, edges, and faces of the coarse shape as a way to manipulate the smooth subdivided surface.  It would definitely be valuable in your modeler to provide this kind of functionality, either by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cloop/accTOG.pdf">approximating subdivision patches with simpler surfaces</a> or simply by coming up with an intelligent scheme to update a fine subdivision mesh whenever the coarse vertices are changed.  One thing to think about here is that, even after <em>n</em> subdivision steps, each subdivided vertex has a linear relationship to the vertices in the control cage.  So, you could precompute a mapping (e.g., a matrix) from coarse positions to fine positions in order to get a fast preview (...until the connectivity of the coarse cage gets updated!).</p></li>

    <!-- Project report section-->

<h3>Part 1: What I did</h3>
<p>The two main objectives of this project were to allow to mutiple selection of nodes (to allow for modelling of a 'group' of edges at once) and the implementation of the Catmull-Clark algorithm to better understand three dimensional meshes and how subdivision works to create smoother images. </p>

<p>The objectives of the project were to: 
<ol>
<li>Allow multiple selection of edges for 'loop' editing (i.e. edit a number of edges at the same time.</li>
<li>Implement the Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm on rendered meshes. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Building the code</h3>

<p>All source files are in the /src folder and have been tested in the GHC clusters. Running the cmake.. and make commands from a created /build folder (similar to building previous projects) works just fine.
</p> 

<h3>Multiple/Loop selection of nodes</h3>

<p>In this first part of the project, the idea was to extend the base code to allow for multiple selection of edges. This would allow for functionality such as creating extrusions to create features such as fingers or hands as is available in common mesh editors such as modo and blender. The starter code was modified in the following way:
<ol>
  <li>To begin multiple selection of nodes, select the 'y' key. To stop multiple selection, select the 'z' key. To allow for this, a few methods were added to meshEdit.cpp. The 2 methods that mark the beginning of common selection of nodes are setCommonCollectStatus() and removeCommonCollectStatus(). These methods set or unset a flag to show that common loop editing was being performed.</li>
<li>void MeshEdit::enactPotentialSelection() was modified to detect selected features and push them into a vector.
</li>
<li>void MeshEdit::drawEdges( HalfedgeMesh& mesh ) was modified to detect a change in the size of the vector storing selected mesh features and automatically adapt the element style

<pre>
 	    // set the default style
            setElementStyle( elementAddress( e ) );

            // find if the current edge is contained as part of the selected edges
            if (selectedMeshFeatures.size() > 0)
            {
                for (std::vector<MeshFeature>::iterator iter = selectedMeshFeatures.begin();
                     iter != selectedMeshFeatures.end(); ++iter )
		     ...
</pre>
</li>
<li>The starter code was modified to create a new style that would represent the selected items that were being modified as a group of edges. This style was applied to edges using the method call setMultipleElementStyle(curr_e) and the new style was created in void MeshEdit::initializeStyle( void ) where it is referred to as combinedStyle with its halfedge, faceColor, edgeColor, vertexColor, strokeWidth and vertexRadius set.
</li>
<li>inline void MeshEdit::setElementStyle( HalfedgeElement* element ) was modified to detect for the edges(elements) that were being looped together for grouping. 
</li>
<li>inline void MeshEdit::setMultipleElementStyle(HalfedgeElement* element) was added to apply the combined style to the selected edges. 
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Results of multiple Loop selection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The modifications successfully allowed users to simultaneously select a number of edges and perform operations. 
</li>
<li>Since most operations as specified in assignment 2 included operations done to single edges e.g. edge flipping and collapse (which were thus unfeaseable as a operation that could be performed on multiple nodes), a method void performExtrusion(vector<HalfedgeElement*> edges) in main.cpp was created. However, there was no time to implement the code perform a simultaneous extrusion of the edges even though the code to do this was created.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementing Catmull Clark Subdivision algorithm</h3>

<p>The subdivision algorithm I created for the second part of the project subdivides a mesh using the Catmull-Clark algorithm. To perform the subdivision, select '9' to increased the subdivision rounds and thus make the image smoother and select '0' to reduce the subdivision rounds and thus make the image less smooth by reducing the number of triangles in the mesh.
</p>

<p>The actual steps taken to perform Catmull-Clark were based off Catmull &  Clarks' 1978 paper on the subdivision method and not on later modifications done to improve the algorithm.</p>

<p>To implement the Catmull-Clark algorithm, a number of changes to the starter code were made namely:
<ol>
<li>A global variable roundsCatmullClark was created and manipulated (i.e. increased or decreased) using the methods MeshEdit::addCatmullClarkSubdivisionLevels() and MeshEdit::removeCatmullClarkSubdivisionLevels(). These methods increased and reduced the number of Catmull-Clark subdivision levels in meshEdit.cpp.</li>

<li>These methods performed Catmull-Clark subdivision on all meshes in the scene. and finally by calling the method HalfedgeMesh* MeshResampler::catmullClarkSubdivide( HalfedgeMesh& mesh, int rounds ) in student_code.cpp to perform the actual Catmull-Clark subdivision steps
</li>

</p>

<p>The steps taken to implement the Catmull-Clark algorithm in the StarterCode in student_code.cpp in HalfedgeMesh* MeshResampler::catmullClarkSubdivide( HalfedgeMesh& mesh, int rounds ) were
<ul>
<li>Find the new face points: Here all edges were traversed and for each face, it's 3 Vector3D vertices were used to find the midpoints dubbed 'face points'.

<pre>
// loop through all half edges
            HalfedgeIter h = vIter->halfedge(); // get one of the outgoing half-edges of the vertex
            do
            {
               // get the half edge's face
               FaceIter currFace = h->face();

               // find if the current face has already been processed
               vector <FaceCIter>::iterator i = processedFaces.begin ();
               i = find(processedFaces.begin (), processedFaces.end(), currFace);

               if (i == processedFaces.end ())
               {
                  cout << "face not found. processing..." << endl ;
                  // ** perform processing **//
                  // get the next 2 vertices
                  VertexCIter vNext = h->next()->next()->vertex() ;
                  VertexCIter vNextNext = h->next()->next()->next()->vertex() ;

                  // get the 3 vertices
                  Vector3D firstVertexLocation = vIter->position ;
                  Vector3D secondVertexLocation = vNext->position ;
                  Vector3D thirdVertexLocation = vNextNext->position ;

                  // get the mean of the location
                  Vector3D meanLocation;
                  //((firstVertexLocation + secondVertexLocation + thirdVertexLocation) /3) ;

                  // append to mean locations
                  currFace->centerPoint = meanLocation ;

                  // add face to set of processed faces
                  processedFaces.push_back(currFace) ;
</pre>

</li>

<li>Finding new edge points: New edge points were determined by traversing each edge and finding the average of the 2 vertices of the edge and the newly created adjacent face points created on each side of the edge. 

<pre>
for (EdgeIter vIter = mesh.edgesBegin() ; vIter != mesh.edgesEnd(); vIter++) {

             cout << "computing average for edge: " << i <<  " " << endl ; i++;

             // get the location for the current vertex
             Vector3D currVertexPos = vIter->halfedge()->vertex()->position ;

             // get the next vertex
             Vector3D vIterNextPos = vIter->halfedge()->next()->vertex()->position ;

             // get the current edge's face' face point
             Vector3D currEdgeFaceCenterPoint = vIter->halfedge()->face()->centerPoint ;

             // get the twin's half edge face's face point
             Vector3D twinHalfEdgeFaceCenterPoint = vIter->halfedge()->twin()->face()->centerPoint ;

             // get the mean of all locations
             vIter->newPosition = (currVertexPos + vIterNextPos + currEdgeFaceCenterPoint + twinHalfEdgeFaceCenterPoint) / 4 ;
          }
</pre>
</li>

<li>Moving vertices to create new control points: New control points or vertices were created by evaluating the formula:

<pre> 
Q/n + 2R/n + S9n-3)/n 

where Q is the average of the sorrounding face points, 
R is the average of the sorrounding midpoints, 
S is the current control point/vertex 
and n is the valence (no of edges from the vertex)
</pre>

<p>This formula then simplified out to:
<pre>
Each new Vertex/Control point = Q/4+R/2+S/4 
since n=4
</pre>
</p>

<p>For each vertex, the function HalfedgeMesh* MeshResampler::catmullClarkSubdivide( HalfedgeMesh& mesh, int rounds ) in student_code.cpp calculated the average of neighboring face points, sorrounding mid points and summed the weighted values of these with the a weighted value of the current control point/vertex to determine the new vertex/control point of the current point</p>

<pre>
for (VertexIter vIter = mesh.verticesBegin() ; vIter != mesh.verticesEnd(); vIter++) {
          cout << "computing midpoints for edge " << i << endl ; i++;
          // get the faces
          // mark as belonging to the old mesh
          vIter->isNew = false;

          // find S (current vertice/control point)
          Vector3D s = vIter->position ;

          // find Q (average of sorrounding Q points)
          Vector3D firstControlPoint = vIter->halfedge()->face()->centerPoint ;
          Vector3D secondControlPoint = vIter->halfedge()->twin()->face()->centerPoint ;
          Vector3D thirdControlPoint = vIter->halfedge()->next()->next()->twin()->face()->centerPoint ;
          Vector3D fourthControlPoint = vIter->halfedge()->twin()->next()->twin()->face()->centerPoint ;

          Vector3D q = (firstControlPoint + secondControlPoint + thirdControlPoint + fourthControlPoint) / 4 ;

          // find R (average of sorrounding edge midpoints)
          Vector3D firstEdgeMidPoint = (s + vIter->halfedge()->next()->vertex()->position) / 2;
          Vector3D secondEdgeMidPoint = (s + vIter->halfedge()->twin()->next()->next()->vertex()->position) / 2;
          Vector3D thirdEdgeMidPoint = (s + vIter->halfedge()->next()->next()->vertex()->position) / 2;
          Vector3D fourthEdgeMidPoint = (s + vIter->halfedge()->next()->next()->twin()->next()->next()->vertex()->position) / 2;

          Vector3D r = (firstEdgeMidPoint + secondEdgeMidPoint + thirdEdgeMidPoint + fourthEdgeMidPoint) / 4 ;

          // implement the formula to get new position for vertex
          vIter->newPosition = q/4 + r/2 + s/4 ;
       }
</pre>
</li>

<li>With an increased number of polygons (triangles in this case) representing the mesh generated, the new face points, edge points and control points/vertices were then joined together to created to form a new mesh that was passed back to the created function inline void MeshEdit::addCatmullClarkSubdivisionLevels() that called the method void MeshEdit::renderMesh( HalfedgeMesh& mesh ) in meshEdit.cpp to render the new mesh. </li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h4>Results of the Catmull Clark Subdivision</h4>

<p>Considerable modification was required to modify the starter code since the code was written to load a Scene from a collada file and render a mesh only once allowing for localized modifications  such as edge flips and collapsing. However for the Catmull-Clark algorithm, an entirely new mesh was created to replace an old one and rendered. The main challenge in creating and rendering a new mesh as required by Catmull clark was that there only existed one method to create new meshes namely <code>void HalfedgeMesh :: build( const vector< vector<Index> >& polygons,const vector<Vector3D>& vertexPositions ) </code>. More discrete methods such as Edge MeshEdit::createEdge(Vector3D start, Vector3D end), Face MeshEdit::createFace(Vector3D v1, Vector3D v2, Vector3D v3), Vertex MeshEdit::createVertex(Vector3D v) were created to allow for the creation of Edges, Vertices and Faces. However, meshes rendered  using the created routines had holes (not manifold), in some cases caused the viewer to crash or render the mesh incorrectly. With more time, more work could have been covered here.
