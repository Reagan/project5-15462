<h3>Part 1: What I did</h3>
<p>The two main objectives of this project were to allow to mutiple selection of nodes (to allow for modelling of a 'group' of edges at once) and the impplementation of the Catmull-Clark algorithm to better understand three dimensional meshes and how subdivision works to creat smoother images. </p>

<h3>Multiple/Loop selection of nodes</h3>

<p>To extend the base code to allow for multiple selection of edges, the starter code was modified in the following way:
<ol>
  <li>To begin multiple selection of nodes, users would select the 'y' key. To stop multiple selection, users would select the 'z' key. To allow for this, a few methods were added to meshEdit.cpp. The 2 methods that mark the beginning of common selection of nodes are setCommonCollectStatus() and removeCommonCollectStatus(). These methods set or unset a flag to show that common loop editing was being performed.</li>
<li>void MeshEdit::enactPotentialSelection() was modified to detect selected features and push them into a vector.
</li>
<li>void MeshEdit::drawEdges( HalfedgeMesh& mesh ) was modified to detect a change in the size of the vector storing selected mesh features and automatically adapt the element style

<code>
 // set the default style
            setElementStyle( elementAddress( e ) );

            // find if the current edge is contained as part of the selected edges
            if (selectedMeshFeatures.size() > 0)
            {
                for (std::vector<MeshFeature>::iterator iter = selectedMeshFeatures.begin();
                     iter != selectedMeshFeatures.end(); ++iter )
</code>
</li>
<li>The starter code was modified to create a new style that would represent the selected items that were being modified as a group of edges. This style was applied to edges using the method call setMultipleElementStyle(curr_e) and the new style was created in void MeshEdit::initializeStyle( void ) where it is referred to as combinedStyle with its halfedge, faceColor, edgeColor, vertexColor, strokeWidth and vertexRadius set.
</li>
<li>inline void MeshEdit::setElementStyle( HalfedgeElement* element ) was modified to detect for the edges(elements) that were being looped together for grouping. 
</li>
<li>inline void MeshEdit::setMultipleElementStyle(HalfedgeElement* element) was added to apply the combined style to the selected edges. 
</ol>

<h4>Results of multiple Loop selection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The modifications successfully allowed users to simultaneously select a number of edges and perform operations. 
</li>
<li>Since most operations as specified in assignment 2 included operations done to single edges e.g. edge flipping and collapse (which were thus unfeaseable as a operation that could be performed on multiple nodes), a method void performExtrusion(vector<HalfedgeElement*> edges) in main.cpp was created. However, there was no time to implement the code perform a simultaneous extrusion of the edges even though the code to do this was created.
</li>
</ul>
